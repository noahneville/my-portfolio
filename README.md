# my-portfolio

This project was to build a portfolio to showcase future work. This project was very challenging and I'm still not fully satisfied and will continue to tinker with this in the future. I had a great deal of trouble figuring out exactly how to implement flexboxes properly to style the site like the example provided. It was a good learning experience and I feel I understand things a bit better.

I showcased flexboxes, hoverstates and @media screen CSS properties to make the website more dynamic.
